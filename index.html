        <p> Hello everyone! I am so excited to be learning with you this semester. 
            I am from Pittsburg, CA. I love learning about how things around us work: 
            cars, remotes, computers, and even how the planets work in conjunction with eachother. </p>
        <p>I have my family to thank for my involvement as a memeber of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter
            Day Saints. They have been a great example to me of discipleship and love.</p>
